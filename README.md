A simple weather app built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs.

## What Am I learning:
I'm learning how to create a responsive website wherein users can input their cities and find out the weather. The app will have changing icons dependent on what the weather is e.g "Raining in the City = Raining Icon".
